> Use it to generate a wall of text in your terminal window to clearly separate actions, events, or changes in log output.

## Install
```console
npm install -g waller
```

## Usage
```console
waller

A default message will appear in the middle of the wall, but you can display your own by using the `-m` flag.

waller -m "Shazam"
```
